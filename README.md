Python is a wonderfull and powerfull programming language that easy to use (easy to read and write).

Python can be used on server to create web applications, for handle big data and perform complex mathematics as well as used for rapid machine learning project. And yes, you can [make robots using Python](https://pythonprogramming.net/robotics-raspberry-pi-tutorial-gopigo-introduction/).

## Why Python?

- Python syntax is very clean, with emphasis of readibility, and uses standard English keyword.
- Python work on multi platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Rasberry Pi etc).
- Python enables developer to write fewer lines of code than other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, that mean the code can be executed as soon as it is written and prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be used in a procedural way, a object-oriented way or a functional way.

## Good to know

- Python has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines for complete command, as opposed to other programming languages which often uses semicolon or parentheses.
- Python relies on identation, using whitespace, to define scope. such as scope of looping, functions and classes. Other programming language usually use curly-brackets for this purpose.

## About this tutorial
- This Python learning will focus for handle data science and machine learning.
- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3 (or Python3), which will use in this tutorial. However, Python 2 (or Python), although will not be updated with anything other security patch, it still quite popular.
- In this tutorial, Python will be writen in Visual Studio Code which using the Microsoft Python extension.
    - This [article](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) provide a overview of the capabilities of Python extension for VS Code.
    - It is possible for you to use any IDE, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse.
- In this tutorial, [Conda or Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/why-anaconda/), that designed for data science and machine learning workflows, will used as platform package and enviroment manager.
    - This [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart) will guide you through installing Anaconda on an Ubuntu 18.04 server.
    - This [article](https://www.anaconda.com/understanding-conda-and-pip/) provide comparasion between conda and pip.
